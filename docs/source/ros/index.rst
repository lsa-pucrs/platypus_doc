There are three parts of the ROS Quick Start tutorials. In the first part, you will get an understanding about ROS main concepts.
Then, you will learn how to develop your first program with ROS, namely programming a publisher and subscriber using both C++ and Python.
Finally, some more advanced concepts will be introduced through the development of a cleaning application with the Turtlesim simulator. 
At the end of ROS Quick Start tutorials, you will get a full understanding of ROS that allows you to dive deeper and develop more advanced robotics applications.
