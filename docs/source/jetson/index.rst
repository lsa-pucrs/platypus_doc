Jetson TK1 Board
-----------------

NVIDIA Tegra K1 (TK1) is NVIDIA's first mobile processor to have the same advanced features & architecture as a modern desktop GPU while still using the low power draw of a mobile chip. Therefore Tegra K1 allows embedded devices to use the exact same CUDA code that would also run on a desktop GPU (used by over 100,000 developers), with similar levels of GPU-accelerated performance as a desktop [1]_.

Jetson TX2 Board
-----------------

NVIDIA Tegra X2 (TX2) is the fastest, most power-efficient embedded AI computing device. This 7.5-watt supercomputer on a module brings true AI computing at the edge. It's built around an NVIDIA Pascal-family GPU and loaded with 8GB of memory and 59.7GB/s of memory bandwidth. It features a variety of standard hardware interfaces that make it easy to integrate it into a wide range of products and form factors. [2]_.
